# RizeMeet is a barebones CMS

You want to regularly meet with a group of friends/colleagues, etc... and coordinating meeting date, time, and place, while having a minimal presnece online that introduces your group.

You need a content management system (CMS), but many of these are overly complex (e.g. Wordpress).

RizeMeet provides:
- Having a static front page
- Dynamic meeting date/time and location update
- Easy publishing of minutes
- Simple mailing list

RizeMeet is meant to coordinate meetings of small groups.
It fits for a specific niche requiring a specific and minimal functionality.

You may find other CMS, such as Hugo, more suitable for anything more full-fledged as a website.

Eventually, there will be the option to determine whether to use a file system for data or DB.

See problems with functionality? Design? Interaction?

Let me know. I want this to be very simple but functional for a specific set of features.
